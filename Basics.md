Docker replaces Virtual Machine (VM). Virtual Machine used on the server to virtualize the server hardware using Hypervisor. 


Server initially has an installed OS that could be Linux/Windows etc. Then, It instals the hypervisor on the OS. That divides the resources of my server to virtually make places for other OSs. Then, guest OSs get installed on the slot and share resources. In short , we may say that , VM virtualized the hardware resources of the server . 


On the other hand , Docker is quite different. It doesnâ€™t virtualize the resources ( CPU, RAM etc ) rather its virtualizes the HOST OSs. That is the most significant difference between docker and VM.
